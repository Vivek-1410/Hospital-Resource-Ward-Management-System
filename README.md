**Hospital Resource & Ward Management System**
**Project Overview :** 

-> The Hospital Resource & Ward Management System is a web-based application designed to help hospitals efficiently manage inpatient resources such as wards, beds, rooms, medical equipment, and staff. The system provides real-time visibility into hospital resource utilization, streamlines patient admission and discharge workflows, and supports data-driven decision-making for hospital administrators.

-> Many small to medium hospitals still rely on manual registers or fragmented software systems, leading to inefficiencies, overcrowding, delayed admissions, and poor resource utilization. This project aims to replace such manual processes with a centralized, user-friendly digital platform.

**Problem It Solves**

1. Hospitals face several operational challenges, including:

2. Manual or disconnected tracking of ward and bed availability

3. Difficulty in managing patient admissions, transfers, and discharges

4. Lack of real-time occupancy visibility

5. Underutilization or overloading of hospital resources

6. Administrative overhead and human errors

Existing hospital management systems are often expensive, complex, and not suitable for small or medium-sized hospitals. This project addresses the need for a simple, affordable, and customizable solution focused specifically on inpatient resource and ward management.
