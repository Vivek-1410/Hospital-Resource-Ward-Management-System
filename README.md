**Hospital Resource & Ward Management System**

**1. Project Overview**

The Hospital Resource & Ward Management System is a web-based application designed to assist hospitals in efficiently managing inpatient resources such as wards, beds, rooms, medical equipment, and staff. The system provides real-time visibility into hospital resource utilization, streamlines patient admission, transfer, and discharge workflows, and supports informed decision-making for hospital administrators.

Many small and medium-sized hospitals continue to rely on manual registers or fragmented digital systems. These approaches often result in inefficiencies such as overcrowding, delayed admissions, inaccurate availability tracking, and poor resource utilization. This project aims to replace such manual processes with a centralized, reliable, and user-friendly digital platform.

**2. Problem Statement**

Hospitals face several operational challenges in managing inpatient resources, including:

Manual or disconnected tracking of ward and bed availability

Difficulty in managing patient admissions, transfers, and discharges

Lack of real-time visibility into ward occupancy

Underutilization or overloading of hospital resources

Increased administrative workload and human errors

Existing hospital management solutions are often expensive, complex, or not tailored to the needs of small and medium hospitals. There is a need for a simple, affordable, and customizable system focused specifically on ward and resource management.

**3. Target Users (Personas)**

**3.1 Hospital Administrator**

Oversees overall hospital operations

Monitors ward occupancy and resource utilization

Requires administrative dashboards, reports, and control features

**3.2 Doctor**

Admits, transfers, and discharges patients

Needs quick access to bed availability and patient records

Requires role-based system access without administrative complexity

**3.3 Nursing and Support Staff**

Manages ward-level operations

Updates patient status and bed allocation

Requires a simple, intuitive, and mobile-friendly interface

**4. Vision Statement**

To develop an intuitive and reliable digital system that simplifies hospital ward and resource management, ensures optimal utilization of inpatient facilities, and improves operational efficiency while maintaining data accuracy and security.

**5. Key Features and Goals**

Project completion within the defined scope and timeline

**7. Assumptions**

Users have access to desktop or mobile devices with web browsers

Hospital staff are willing to transition from manual processes to a digital system

Reliable internet connectivity is available within the hospital

The development team has access to required open-source development tools

**8. Constraints**

The project must be completed within a three-month development timeline

Only free and open-source technologies will be used

The development team consists of students with basic to intermediate technical skills

The user interface must remain simple and easy to use for non-technical users

Patient and operational data must be securely stored and accessed
